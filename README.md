# olivias-web-piano
Simple web page with a playable Piano made with html and java.
I made this after watching an online tutorial on javascript using the same concept but making it my own style.
This can be used as a template and is free to use and change it. 
There is an issue with the algorythim that assigns the notes to the individual keys.(if you can fix it that will be great and i will give you credit)
